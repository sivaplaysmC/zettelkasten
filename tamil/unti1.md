metallurg - scientific field that studies the material science, engineering, physical, chemical properties of metals, intermaetallic compunds, and alloys.

metallurgy - technique concerned with extraction and utilization of metals and alloys

tamil nadu excelled in metallurgy 2500 years ago
proof: cattle-iron products, metal products, bronze utils, weapons found in tamilnadu

damascus sword: world famouse Damascus sword, created by excellent high quality organic steeel made in south india.
references: greek, rome, persia

professor saratha srinavasan:

- researched high technological techniques used in tin and bronze metallurgy during iron age at adichanalur
- obtained field evidences are among the best specimens ever found in metallurgical excavations
- in her research paper, she points out evidence of high organic iron prod in south arcot
- beta bronze:
  - broze east at high temperature. called beta bronze, the intermetallic compund state between two meatls is known as beta state
  - cast with copper and silver
  - 23% silver gives best yield

pottery:

- Kuyavanthozhil, potter is called kuyavar
  - requirements:
    - correct clay soil
    - correct time
    - correct temperature

  - pottery technology:
    - potter's wheel:
      - Ball point rotator:
        - less amount of clay
        - bottom ball pointy
      - Cone slot rotator:
        - more amount of clay
        - pointy bottom slot

- clay soil:
  - first layer:
    - pure
    - does not contain sedemnts
    - heavy, pure
  - second layer:
    - not that pure
    - contains light sedemnt layer
    - lighter than first layer

- black-red pots:
  - trend that emerged in uttar pradesh
  - continued in central parts of india
  - process:
    - potters at keezhadi used special techniques and materials to create black-red pottery
    - red is due to haematite (iron)
    - black is due to graphite
  - nano technology
    - nano technology comes when heating the pot
    - reason for intergrity:
      - carbon nano tubes:
        - 100x stronger than steel of same quantity
        - comes in single and multi variants, both fond in keezhdai
        - black interior did not tarnish due to this carbon nanotube
  - colouring the pots
    - coloring done by adding dye at the right temperature.
    - only natural dyes were used

- scratch code on vessels
