  - ## Modern vs sangam smelting
    - Sangam methods of metallurgy, specifiically iron smelting were similar are similar to modern methds of metallurgy
    - The rock is broken, mixed with charcoal powder to ensure correct carbon content, and the roasted at high temperatures for the elements to melt and eventually fuse.
